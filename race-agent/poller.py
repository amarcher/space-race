Race Agent sweep engine — the Slack front door to Andrew's Claude Code, for
the space-race project.

One call = one sweep. daemon.py (the launchd KeepAlive process) triggers a
sweep the moment Slack pushes a message/reaction event over Socket Mode, and
as a periodic fallback in case an event is missed. A sweep reads the
#space-race channel (C0BQ3571U1Z, The Archers workspace) with the Space Race Claude
bot token from the persisted watermark; on a new human message (top-level or
in a tracked thread) it wakes `claude -p --model opus` headless in the repo
with the thread as context. The headless agent does everything else —
classification, building, gating, replying — under race-agent/RUNNER.md and
race-agent/policy.md. The sweep stays a dumb, provable transport: detect,
dedupe, spawn, never interpret. (Running this file by hand performs a single
sweep — the event push only decides WHEN sweeps happen, never WHAT they do.)

This is a direct port of smart-home/house-agent's poller.py — same shape,
same safety spine — adapted for a different Slack workspace (The Archers, not
the family workspace), a single trust tier (Andrew; no second "alicia"-style
tier — see policy.md), and Opus instead of the CLI's default model. The
follow-through changes of 2026-09-01 (wake notes, the continue chain, the
ledger and budget, linked memory, the PR watch, two lanes) were ported from
storybook-studio/fable-agent, where they landed first.

Approval loop: when the agent needs Andrew's 👍 it writes a pending file into
STATE_DIR/pending/<message_ts>.json (see RUNNER.md). Each cycle the poller
checks reactions on those messages; Andrew's 👍/👎 wakes the agent again with
the verdict. Nobody else's reactions count.

Safety spine:
  * two lanes, one lock each (dead-pid reclaimed): the Slack lane (this
    sweep and its wakes) and the follow-through lane (queued items, CI-fix
    wakes, run by worklist.py/prwatch.py). A slow build on one lane never
    makes the other wait, and nothing ever runs twice in one lane
  * at-most-once: state advances BEFORE the spawn, so a crashing agent can't
    poison-loop on one message; the failure posts a fallback line
  * at-most-once ACROSS the two spawn paths too: an approval run that already
    had the message in front of it and replied after it means the message
    sweep in the same cycle must not wake a second session on it
    (drop_answered) — otherwise the thread gets two replies to one message
  * the bot's own messages and join/leave noise never wake the agent
  * everything run-generated — AND both Slack tokens — lives OUTSIDE the
    repo (~/.space-race/race-agent), beyond the reach of any git clean
  * every wake runs in its OWN disposable `git worktree` cut fresh from
    `origin/main` — never the shared repo checkout. This closes a real
    incident hit by a sibling port of this exact pattern
    (storybook-studio/fable-agent, 2026-08-14): two wakes sharing one
    checkout let wake N+1 branch from wake N's leftover feature branch
    instead of a clean main, and its "one-line fix" PR squash-merged wake
    N's entire unreviewed diff onto main as a stowaway. See
    `make_worktree`/`remove_worktree`/`register_resume` below — preserved
    (never deleted) if a run leaves uncommitted/unpushed work behind, with
    a 👍-gated resume ask so that work is never silently lost or silently
    resumed either.
  * ONE spawn path: `wake_agent` is the only thing that ever runs `claude`.
    worklist.py (queued items) and prwatch.py (CI fixes) call it; they never
    spawn on their own, so the worktree, the memory link, the budget, the
    ledger, the continue chain and the PR watch apply to every wake alike.

The RACE_AGENT_* env overrides are the offline-selftest seam (selftest.py):
they redirect the Slack API base, token file, state dir, claude binary, and
repo dir so a verification run can never read the real token, touch Slack,
or spawn a real agent. Production never sets them.
