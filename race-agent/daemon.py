"""
Race Agent daemon — Socket Mode push, so #space-race feels instant.

Runs under launchd (com.archer.race-agent.plist, KeepAlive) on the pyenv
python that carries slack_sdk. It holds an outbound WebSocket to Slack
(Socket Mode — no inbound port, no tunnel); when Slack pushes a message in
#space-race from anyone but the bot, or one of Andrew's reactions, it
triggers a poller.py sweep. The sweep — not the event — decides what to do:
all dedupe/watermark/tier/approval logic stays in poller.py where the
selftest proves it, so a replayed, forged-looking, or duplicate event can at
worst cause a no-op sweep.

This is a direct port of smart-home/house-agent's daemon.py — same
self-restart/heartbeat mechanism, same reasoning — pointed at a different
Slack workspace and repo. See poller.py's module docstring for what's
different (workspace, single trust tier, Opus).

Reliability: events only mark a flag; the main loop runs sweeps serially
(the Slack-lane lock in poller.py guards cross-process too), and after each
sweep kicks one pass of the follow-through lane (worklist.py --run) as a
child process on its own lock. A fallback
sweep every FALLBACK_SWEEP_S catches anything a dropped event missed, and
one catch-up sweep runs at every (re)connect — a Mac wake or Slack flap
never loses messages, because the watermark is the source of truth.

Staying current: this process does `import poller` once and then runs
forever under KeepAlive, so it holds whatever poller.py said the day it
started. house-agent learned this the hard way (a month of landed fixes
looked deployed and were not, 2026-08-01) — so this loop fingerprints its
own sources every idle tick and os.execv's onto anything new, and writes a
heartbeat (STATUS_FILE) naming the code it is actually running.

slack_sdk is imported lazily inside main(): scripts/check-equivalent
py_compile and the selftest (which drives relevant(), the restart decision,
and the poller directly) run on the stdlib-only system python.
