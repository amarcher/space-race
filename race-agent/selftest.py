"""Offline race-agent selftest — proves the #space-race poller BEFORE it ever
touches Slack or spawns a real agent. No network, no real token, no `claude`,
no GitHub.

A right-sized port of smart-home/house-agent's selftest.py for this project:
same seam pattern (stub Slack API on loopback + a recorder stub for `claude`,
all via RACE_AGENT_* env overrides), a smaller scenario set matched to what's
actually different here (single trust tier, Opus on every spawn, a different
workspace/channel) — PLUS the worktree-isolation regression suite ported from
storybook-studio/fable-agent (2026-08-14 incident: see poller.py's
make_worktree docstring), PLUS the follow-through suite ported from the same
place on 2026-09-01 (conditions, two lanes, wake notes, the continue chain,
linked memory, the PR-watch verdict, the budget). The worktree scenarios run
against a REAL local git repo + bare "origin" (a few `git init`/`git init
--bare`/`git push` calls in fixture setup) — not a mocked filesystem —
because that's the exact seam a mock would paper over.

Contract pins first:
  * the daemon plist points at daemon.py in the DEPLOY checkout, with
    logs under STATE_DIR (outside the repo); the daylight plist is GONE
  * poller.py's CHANNEL/ANDREW/TIER_MODE/CLAUDE_MODEL/CLAUDE_TIMEOUT_S pins:
    bypassPermissions is reachable ONLY from the andrew tier; every spawn
    uses --model opus; the run cap is 45 (not 30) minutes
  * both token files default to STATE_DIR outside the repo (the house-agent
    2026-07-03 git-clean class)
  * the worktree machinery (make_worktree/remove_worktree/register_resume)
    exists in poller.py, and worklist.py spawns ONLY through poller.wake_agent
  * the follow-through contract (check_worklist_contract): no daylight job,
    conditions in code, one spawn path, the tier gate stamped at the spawn
    boundary, the plain-voiced stuck notice, budget/ledger/memory/continue/
    PR-watch pins, the PR template's Verified section, and the docs that
    promise all of it

Then the behavioral proof against a stub Slack API, a stub `claude` binary
that records its argv/cwd and answers like the real binary's
`--output-format json` result, and a real git repo + bare origin:
  1. seams wired — token/state/API/claude/repo all redirected
  2. first sweep only ARMS the watermark: a channel with backlog spawns
     nothing
  3. a new message from Andrew wakes the agent once, tier "andrew",
     --permission-mode bypassPermissions, --model opus, in an ISOLATED
     worktree containing origin/main's content, acked with an eyes
     reaction, cleaned up after
  4. a new message from anyone else wakes the agent once, tier "unknown",
     --permission-mode acceptEdits
  5. a repeat sweep with nothing new spawns nothing (dedupe)
  6. the bot's own messages and bot_id messages (any bot integration)
     never wake the agent
  7. thread replies (invisible to channel history) are picked up via the
     tracked-thread watermark
  8. singleton: a held lock skips the sweep
  9. approvals: Andrew's 👍 wakes the agent with verdict approved and clears
     the pending file; his 👎 → denied; a NON-Andrew 👍 decides nothing
 10. worktree isolation: two separate wakes never share a worktree directory
 11. a wake that leaves uncommitted work has its worktree PRESERVED, not
     deleted
 12. a run that already replied since it started never gets the generic
     fallback stacked on top
 13. a run that fails AND leaves real work behind gets a 👍-gated resume ask
     (not the fallback); Andrew's 👍 resumes it IN THE SAME worktree; a
     resume that resolves its own leftover gets cleanly removed after
 14. a failing spawn with no leftover work posts the plain fallback and the
     watermark still advances (no poison loop)
 15. the follow-through queue (worklist.py): only an Andrew-tier run may
     file; an unknown --wait is refused; an item with no condition runs on
     the very next pass — 03:12 included — in its OWN worktree, ungated,
     with kind "worklist" and its note/continue paths; `done` retires the
     item into worklist/done/; daytime / cmd: / after: / approval
     conditions each gate and clear on their own; priority order; an item
     that never closes reopens, and after three dead passes costs Andrew
     exactly ONE plain in-thread notice — never repeated. That notice says
     the item's `public_title` and NEVER its agent-voiced `title` (the
     real "Deploy PR #196 ..." shape is replayed as a fixture), an
     ops-flavoured public_title is dropped rather than tidied, and an item
     parked on an unanswered 👍 says it's waiting rather than claiming
     three failed tries. Two lanes: the queue runs while a Slack wake
     holds its lock; a second queue pass waits for the first.
 16. the wake note: written by the run, handed back to the next wake on
     the same thread, headlined + costed in the ledger with its session
 17. follow through: a run that writes its continue file is woken again
     AT ONCE in the same worktree with that note; the file is consumed;
     the chain is bounded at MAX_CONTINUES (6)
 18. memory: the worktree's project memory is a link to the main
     checkout's (realpath keys); stray pre-existing memory is folded in
 19. the PR watch's whole policy as a pure function: DIRTY / red /
     under-counted / unverified / pending-Vercel never read as green
 20. money: over the day's cap a wake is QUEUED for the morning, not
     dropped, and the thread hears one plain line (once a day); it runs
     as itself when the day turns. Last, because the seeded spend blocks
     every wake after it.

Exit 0 = pass; non-zero with a RACE-AGENT SELFTEST FAIL line otherwise.
