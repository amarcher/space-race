PR watch — the part of a wake that used to happen to nobody.

A run ends when its pull request opens. Everything that decides whether the
work actually lands happens after that: the checks, the merge-state trap (a
DIRTY merge state never runs anything and reads as green), the check-count
rule, and the merge itself. Those were rules a headless run had no way to
follow. This process follows them.

poller.wake_agent starts one of these, detached, for every run that leaves
a branch behind. It polls the PR and acts on exactly three states:

  red     a check failed, or the PR conflicts with main → wake the agent
          again on the PR's own branch (kind "ci-fix"), at most MAX_FIXES
          times, then one plain line to the thread
  green   every check finished and passed, at least MIN_CHECKS of them,
          merge state clean, and the PR body carries its Verified block →
          Andrew-tier work merges; anything else registers a 👍 ask whose
          approval wake runs the merge
  pending keep watching, up to WATCH_S; then stop quietly — a PR that is
          still building after that is unusual enough that the ledger
          line is the right record, not a message

What "green" means HERE. This repo has no GitHub Actions: every PR to it
carries exactly two checks, both Vercel's — the `Vercel` status context
(the preview deployment, which runs `tsc -b && vite build` under web/,
i.e. the gate itself) and the `Vercel Preview Comments` check run. Read
off the last three merged PRs (#188, #189, #190) with
`gh pr view N --json statusCheckRollup` on 2026-09-01: 2, 2, 2 — the same
count on a docs-only PR as on a code PR, because Vercel deploys every push.
So MIN_CHECKS is 2, and "green" is "Vercel built it and nothing conflicts".
A Vercel status context reports through `state` (PENDING/SUCCESS/FAILURE),
not `status`/`conclusion` — so a pending deployment is treated as running,
never as a completed check with no conclusion (a fable-agent verdict would
have read that as green once the count was met).

Every action writes a ledger line (poller.append_ledger). Wakes run on the
follow-through lane (poller.acquire_lock("work.lock")) so a fix never
collides with a queued item.

Offline seam: RACE_AGENT_GH overrides the `gh` binary (the selftest points
it at a scripted stub); `verdict()` is pure and driven directly.
