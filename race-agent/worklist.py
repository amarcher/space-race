The follow-through queue — what Space Race Claude will do next, and what it
is waiting on.

This used to be "the daylight worklist" (a direct port of
smart-home/house-agent's): a run that found more to do filed it here and a
launchd job worked the queue at 09:40 and 14:40. That is why a thread could
go quiet for days and then get a report. The rule now is the other way round
(RUNNER.md, "Follow through"): a run FINISHES its own follow-ups — when one
cap isn't enough it writes its continue file and the poller wakes it again
at once. This queue holds only the work that cannot run yet, and every item
says why:

    --wait approval          Andrew's 👍 on an ask further up the thread
    --wait after:<ISO time>  not before this moment (a store's review
                             window, tomorrow morning, "after the 3pm deploy")
    --wait daytime           09–18 only — for anything that would be
                             disruptive out of hours (kept from the house
                             bot; nothing in this repo makes noise)
    --wait cmd:<shell>       whatever this command exits 0 for: a booted
                             simulator, a device on `xcrun devicectl`, an
                             App Store Connect build finished processing
    --wait ci:<pr>           the checks on that PR have all finished

An item with no `--wait` is ready now: the poller's sweep picks it up on
the follow-through lane within seconds of the run that filed it ending.

The second source of items is GitHub: an open issue labelled
`agent-ready` (ISSUE_LABEL) becomes an item on the next pass. That is how a
roadmap turns into work the agent picks up unattended — Andrew writes the
issue, the agent opens the PR, the PR says `Closes #N`, and the issue's
timeline is the record of what happened.

Every spawn goes through poller.wake_agent — the ONE spawn path: isolated
worktree, linked memory, budget, ledger, continue chain, PR watch. This
file only decides WHICH item is ready; it never runs an agent itself.
(race-agent used to carry its own wake_agent here, with its own worktree —
that was the right instinct and it is now the poller's job for every wake.)

The escape hatch is the honest part: an item that fails MAX_ATTEMPTS passes
goes `stuck`, and that — a thing genuinely needing Andrew — is the only
case that ever costs him a message. Not a list; one item, with the reason.
Because it is the ONE unprompted message the whole design allows, it has to
be the best-written line the bot sends: see `compose_stuck_notice` for why
the item's own `title` is never allowed anywhere near it (whoever else ever
joins #space-race shouldn't get a build log for a stuck item either).

Trust: `add` refuses unless the filing run is an Andrew-tier run (the poller
stamps RACE_AGENT_TIER at the spawn boundary), so a queued item always
traces back to a session Andrew's own messages authorized. An issue item is
Andrew-tier because only the repo's owner labels issues on it. That stamp
is what justifies the wake's permission mode — poller.py's TIER_MODE rule,
carried across the queue: text in a public channel must never be able to
conjure an ungated agent.

Usage (the agent's side, from a woken session):
    python3 race-agent/worklist.py add --title "..." --detail "..." \\
        [--public-title "..."] [--thread <ts>] [--priority 2] [--wait ...]
    python3 race-agent/worklist.py list [--json]
    python3 race-agent/worklist.py done <id> [--note "what landed"]
    python3 race-agent/worklist.py drop <id> [--note "why"]

Usage (the daemon's side, one pass on the follow-through lane):
    python3 race-agent/worklist.py --run

The RACE_AGENT_* env overrides are the offline-selftest seam, exactly as in
poller.py: state dir, claude binary, repo dir, and the clock. Production
never sets them.
